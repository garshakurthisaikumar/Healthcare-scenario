Overview of the Scenario:

In the modern world, wellness and healthy living have taken centre stage in healthcare. Your job as a data analyst is to assist a healthcare organisation in analysing patient wellness trends so they may enhance their healthy living initiatives. You have been given access to a simulated dataset by the organisation that contains details about a population of patients' BMI (body mass index), frequency of exercise, quality of diet, length of sleep, and stress levels. To better understand the patients' wellbeing profiles and spot chances for focused health interventions, you want to divide the patient population into discrete clusters.

Instructions for the Task:

Creation of Datasets:

A simulated dataset containing a range of wellness and health indicators is provided (e.g., stress level score, BMI, hours of sleep per night, number of nutritious meals per day, daily exercise time). Utilise this dataset for dimensionality reduction and clustering. Learning Aims:

Clustering: To group patients with similar wellness profiles, use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering). Examine and interpret the data to comprehend various patient demographics and their behavioural patterns. Dimensionality Reduction: To make the dataset less complex, use Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Examine how the decrease of dimensionality affects the results of the clustering process and analyse the PCA components. Data Exploration: Using Python libraries such as pandas, plotly, matplotlib, and seaborn, do exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in the health and wellness data.
Coding: Upload your Python script to a GitHub repository. Make sure it contains: Model development for clustering. Application of PCA to reduce dimensionality. illustrations that provide context for your findings (e.g., cluster scatter plots, PCA components). Display: Make a presentation outlining your methodology, conclusions, and suggestions for enhancing the wellness initiative. Talk about your findings in class, emphasising how the healthcare organisation might be able to customise wellness programs for various patient groups with the use of clustering. Team Option: You have the option of working alone or in groups of up to three pupils. Deliverables:

Your Python code and documentation should be in a GitHub project. a PDF of your presentation with a summary of your conclusions and recommendations. Give a presentation of your analysis in class. Assessment:
